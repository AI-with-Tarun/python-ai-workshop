They have just taken Luxe and created something I had in my head and brought it to life. Every day I wake up, start my day, and get to work. I'm still mind-blown that Luxe is real and live, where people register and travelers visit the site. It would not have been possible without the entire Atyantik team and their commitment to going above and beyond, bringing Luxe to life. With your efforts, you have created jobs for people and created a unicorn for the travel industry. Luxe has a long road to go and many milestones to achieve.I look forward to achieving these and long-term collaboration with the fantastic Atyantik team.I value you all, and thank you for bringing Luxe to life. \n\nTanique Van Dijk\nLuxe Global\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighly Professional and Problem solver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to thank the entire Atyantik team; because of them, we have made the WaveRFID project a reality. We couldn&apos;t have done it without Atyantik. When we started with the project, we were unsure if this could be achievable. The Atyantik team, from the founder to everyone with whom we worked, is focused on solving problems. The Atyantik team is very innovative, flexible, and very professional. It has been more about a partnership where all work together as the s ame team towards the same goals.The Atyantik team has always been swift and adaptive to new technologies, learning & implementation. It brings the best effort to our project so WAVE RFID can provide the best optical inventory management solution. With Atyantik, we delivered a product that our customers love and have relied on us for the last six years to keep their business running. As we continue to grow, we look forward to working with more people from the Atyantik team. \n\nDarla Shewmaker\nWAVE RFID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncredible Partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for being such incredible partners.The Atyantik team brings with them a lot of experience and knowledge, which allowed us to work in collaboration and deliver phase one of the very critical project within the stipulated timeline. ExecRentACar is our first venture into a rental car website with a vision to create a rental car company. Our stakeholders were interested in creating consumer web experiences within an abridged timeline. The Atyantik team facilitated all these, creating a customizable front-end and integrating it with a reservation system in the United States. What we accomplished is remarkable, and blew away everyone at the work, delivered in such a short timeline.We are looking forward to collaborating more in the future and continuing to deliver the ultimate solution. \n\nGary Delosa\nFoxDealer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProven Experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo excited to work with Atyantik, who are engaged in creating our next platform for the business. For Drop, product delivery management is the core business area that has been an offline model. However, with the help of Atyantik, we were able to take the business to a web-based software solution. I appreciate all the efforts to make our web solution a success. \n\nVanessa Gabriel\nDrop Delivery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrop platform is a massive project requiring a skilled team and problem solver to deal with new challenges in the delivery industry. The Atyantik team has added much value to the drop product for the past couple of years. Excellent delivery and technical expertise are what I believe sets them apart from others. The process is much more than just incorporating design or features as a solution, but they do a great job of thinking beyond the original product scope to solve issues that may come up in the future, which provides a much more scalable product to the end-user. \n\nMarc Lopez\nDrop Delivery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've worked with Atyantik for a bit less than a year and I am thoroughly impressed. They strive to exceed our expectations and do repeatedly. They've taken ideas and plans that we've been working on and, with consultation, they add additional value, capability and flexibility within the scope of the original design. They are completely competent and responsive. They rock the development world. \n\nDoug Johnson\nWave RFID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld class projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've worked with Atyantik on a number of projects.

Their willingness to always go above and beyond the required task is unmatched. Whenever an emergency crops up, even after hours, they are always willing to investigate and solve the problem immediately.

They have just taken Luxe and created something I had in my head and brought it to life. Every day I wake up, start my day, and get to work. I'm still mind-blown that Luxe is real and live, where people register and travelers visit the site. It would not have been possible without the entire Atyantik team and their commitment to going above and beyond, bringing Luxe to life. With your efforts, you have created jobs for people and created a unicorn for the travel industry. Luxe has a long road to go and many milestones to achieve.I look forward to achieving these and long-term collaboration with the fantastic Atyantik team.I value you all, and thank you for bringing Luxe to life. \n\nTanique Van Dijk\nLuxe Global\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighly Professional and Problem solver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to thank the entire Atyantik team; because of them, we have made the WaveRFID project a reality. We couldn&apos;t have done it without Atyantik. When we started with the project, we were unsure if this could be achievable. The Atyantik team, from the founder to everyone with whom we worked, is focused on solving problems. The Atyantik team is very innovative, flexible, and very professional. It has been more about a partnership where all work together as the s ame team towards the same goals.The Atyantik team has always been swift and adaptive to new technologies, learning & implementation. It brings the best effort to our project so WAVE RFID can provide the best optical inventory management solution. With Atyantik, we delivered a product that our customers love and have relied on us for the last six years to keep their business running. As we continue to grow, we look forward to working with more people from the Atyantik team. \n\nDarla Shewmaker\nWAVE RFID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncredible Partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for being such incredible partners.The Atyantik team brings with them a lot of experience and knowledge, which allowed us to work in collaboration and deliver phase one of the very critical project within the stipulated timeline. ExecRentACar is our first venture into a rental car website with a vision to create a rental car company. Our stakeholders were interested in creating consumer web experiences within an abridged timeline. The Atyantik team facilitated all these, creating a customizable front-end and integrating it with a reservation system in the United States. What we accomplished is remarkable, and blew away everyone at the work, delivered in such a short timeline.We are looking forward to collaborating more in the future and continuing to deliver the ultimate solution. \n\nGary Delosa\nFoxDealer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProven Experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo excited to work with Atyantik, who are engaged in creating our next platform for the business. For Drop, product delivery management is the core business area that has been an offline model. However, with the help of Atyantik, we were able to take the business to a web-based software solution. I appreciate all the efforts to make our web solution a success. \n\nVanessa Gabriel\nDrop Delivery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrop platform is a massive project requiring a skilled team and problem solver to deal with new challenges in the delivery industry. The Atyantik team has added much value to the drop product for the past couple of years. Excellent delivery and technical expertise are what I believe sets them apart from others. The process is much more than just incorporating design or features as a solution, but they do a great job of thinking beyond the original product scope to solve issues that may come up in the future, which provides a much more scalable product to the end-user. \n\nMarc Lopez\nDrop Delivery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've worked with Atyantik for a bit less than a year and I am thoroughly impressed.
